#Build
Until further development, it needs a few manual steps.
- delete gen folder
- remove the line 'parserUtilClass="..."' from SpaghettiModule.bnf
- right click on the .bnf file add run: Generate Parser Code, Generate JFlex Lexer, Generate Parser Utils

After these you will still have to fix 2 missing imports in the generated code.
